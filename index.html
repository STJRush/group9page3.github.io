          <h1>about intel</h1>
          <p>Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore  During the 1990s,<br>
        Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry<br>
        During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position<br>
        Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981.<br>
        Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971<br>
        it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business</P>
