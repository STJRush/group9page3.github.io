          <h1>About Intel</h1>
          <p>Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore  During the 1990s,<br>
        Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry<br>
        During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position<br>
        Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981.<br>
        Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971<br>
        it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business</P>
      
    <h2>Intel Products</h2>
<p>Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell.<br>
    Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.</P>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Intel was founded in Mountain View, California in 1968 by Gordon E. Moore, a chemist, and Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit.<br>
Arthur Rock (investor and venture capitalist) helped them find investors, while Max Palevsky was on the board from an early stage.<br>
Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel. Rock was not an employee, but he was an investor and was chairman of the board.<br>
The total initial investment in Intel was $2.5 million convertible debentures and $10,000 from Rock.<br>
Just 2 years later, Intel became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share).<br.<br>
Intel's third employee was Andy Grove, a chemical engineer, who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s.<br>
In deciding on a name, Moore and Noyce quickly rejected homophone for "more noise" â€“ an ill-suited name for an electronics company, since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference.<br>
Instead, they founded the company as N M Electronics on July 18, 1968 but by the end of the month had changed the name to Intel which stood for Integrated Electronics.<br>
    Since "Intel" was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco, they had to buy the rights for the name.<br></P>
